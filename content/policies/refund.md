### Cancellation/Returns and Refund Policy
Since Art Hub Studio LLC’s business is comprised of 50% retail and 50% services, our cancellation/returns and refund policy is split into two sections. These sections are tailored for your unique situation of either purchasing retail merchandise, or hiring us for Licensor services.

Any orders made after 1:00 p.m. will be processed the following business day. Processed means confirmation and the initiation of fulfilling your order. During fulfillment, time is of the essence to print, package and ship your order, which may be a few days after processing your order. Business structuring and operations within Art Hub Studio LLC may change order processing schedule at time of high demand or during holidays at the company’s discretion, any delays the company deems potentially unreasonable may result in notification to customer.

#### Artist/Seller/Licensor Warehouse Inventory Return Request
1. You may request your warehoused inventory to be returned by contacting Art Hub Studio through the contact form, by email Brooke.Schutz@arthub.studio, or by phone (607) 325-5500.

Warehouse, crating and packaging costs are invoiced to the Licensor as accounts payable. The costs of these services are automatically taken out at the time of sale, along with commission.  If no sale was made, and a Licensor requests their inventory back, the costs recorded are still owed by the Licensor. ART HUB STUDIO LLC WILL NOT RETURN YOUR INVENTORY UNTIL THESE COSTS ARE PAID.  *Further, in the event of outstanding balance due, you agree to forego and relinquish any possessory interest in property held by Art Hub Studio LLC until such time as all debts are satisfied.

The Licensor agrees and consents to the establishment of this lien and action described in the event they are unable to satisfy debts within ***90 days***.
