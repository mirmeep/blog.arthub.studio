Are you someone who’s looking to create, but is stuck? In the middle of a piece or itching to start one, but don’t know where to begin?

NONE TO WORRY!

Here, at Art Hub Studio, we care about the success of caring, passionate artists. We want to see you succeed and excel in your skill and to help get your work out in the world.

#### What is Artist’s block?

Artist’s block is when your motivation and creative juices have been fully wrung. Last week, you may have had amazing, groundbreaking ideas, but now you are left scratching your head, not sure where those ideas went. 

This is a normal barrier that occurs in the majority of artists.

#### How do I overcome Artist’s block?

Everyone is different. There is a ton of advice given online, which answers this specific question, but the greatest piece of advice that is overlooked is…

GIVE YOURSELF TIME! AND REST!

You may have been creating art for years at this point. Of course, you’d get burnt out eventually. Everyone does. Step away from the easel and come back later. Your paint brush isn’t going anywhere. Besides, if you’re already selling through us, we already have all these prints of yours to sell.

#### But I already took a break and feel well rested. What do I do now?

Still stuck? Maybe you have to revisit the basics again. Copy the old masters like you did in school. Practice figure drawing and still lifes. Study and analyze art, keeping a journal as you go along, documenting any and all artist processes you have come across. Maybe you have to try out new styles or new mediums. Experiment while having fun at the same time.

Not everything you create has to be sold through us. We understand if you need some time to recuperate your art.

Talk to us if you want some human-to-human contact, someone to bounce off your ideas to.

GOOD LUCK!
