*Town Gossip here! I know a place to get the best local produce. The owner, Alexander Stonepelt, used to work at the China shop down the road, but got fired for unknown reasons. Down on his luck, Alex pursued his own dreams of becoming a shop owner, and a successful one at that! The crime rate at his corner store is next to none. Thieves and shoplifters seem to never test Alex. Although he looks tough on the outside, he’s one big mush on the inside. I hear he gives sweets to the calves passing through.*

This mythical shopkeeper wears an earthy, green apron over a freshly pressed white shirt. Dressed to impress, Alex shows confidence and pride in his work. His septum piercing hints at a dark and mysterious past of being controlled by others, but now he finds solace in his own peaceful shop. *Grocery Store Bull*, created by Tony Murchison, displays natural hues such as muted browns, dark crimsons, and olive greens. These colors become illuminated from a light seeping through the storefront window giving this image depth. The produce, potions, and tonics on the shelves imply that this local shop is a staple in Town. The advertisement posted at the front counter alludes to job offers for local adventurers passing through. The old timey till indicates a Gilded Aged Town on the outside of the shop where noisy crowds and headstrong travelers stride through the bustling mainstreet.

If you ever visit this Town, I’m sure you’ll pass through Alexander Stonepelt’s essential shop.
