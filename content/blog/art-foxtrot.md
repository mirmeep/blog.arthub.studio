Tony Murchison’s *Foxtrot* takes a humorous twist by subverting expectations of the power dynamic between predator versus prey.\
\
The fox stands steadfast with great pride, as his bushy tail mocks his assailants. He irreverently looks off into the distance as if the opposition is of no threat to him. He must prevent his brethren from being hunted by the hunters, for Reynard is the hunter of hunters. \
\
As the cunning fox lowers his paw into his gun pouch, his foes slowly back up and cower in fear. There is no need to rush, for he knows he holds the advantage over his enemies. There is no need to stalk, for his confidence needn’t be hidden in order to slay his rivals.  He is his own knight in shining armor, a legend that only few believe, apprehended and apparent as the clouds break for sun to wash over this hero. The light bathes his fur, his armor, even his clothes, revealing a beauty that will turn into children’s stories and nursery rhymes for generations to come. \
\
The fox stands alone against a smooth blue gradient backdrop where shadows ground and stabilize him. A lack of landscape suggests that in his own world nobody can bewilder him, nobody can truly threaten him, and nobody can stop him to fulfill his destiny: To take back what is rightfully his from his former hunters.
