Tony Murchison’s *Reynard, Hunter of Hunters* takes a humorous twist by subverting expectations of the power dynamic between predator versus prey.\
\
Reynard, the fox, stands there with great pride, bushy tail mocking his assailants. He irreverently looks off into the distance past us, the viewers, as if we are of no threat to him. The fox has other important business to attend to. He must prevent his brethren from being hunted by the hunters, as Reynard is the hunter of hunters.\
\
After the cunning fox fires a few warning shots, his foes back up as he slowly lowers his paw into his gun pouch to reload. There is no need to rush, for he knows he holds the advantage over his enemies. There is no need to stalk, for his confidence needn’t be hidden in order to slay his rivals.  He is his own knight in shining armor, a legend that only few believe, that of which is now apparent as the clouds break to allow sun to wash over this hero. The light bathes his fur, his armor, even his clothes, revealing a beauty that will turn into children’s stories and nursery rhymes for generations to come.\
\
A lack of landscape suggests that in his own world nobody can bewilder him, nobody can truly threaten him, and nobody can stop him to fulfill his destiny: To take back what is rightfully his from his former hunters.\
\
Reynard, Hunter of Hunters, is unstoppable.
