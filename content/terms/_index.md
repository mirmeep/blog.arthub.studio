All users of any service provided by or otherwise derivative of Art Hub Studio LLC’s mission to create a thriving and creative environment of artistic exchange agree to adhere, follow, and uphold all tenants of our community guidelines.

Our community guidelines discourage and prohibit the following behaviors:

- Spamming of commentary on public post boards or private emails beyond what is necessary to convey a genuine bonafide purchasing experience. (View “Use of Communication Services” for more detail)

- Commentary should be tied to the business conducted on the Site. Reasonably offensive communications directed toward an artist and their work may be removed and result in account processing action such as suspension, or in extreme cases, termination and revocation of access licenses.

- Information which conveys – absent express permission – personal information regarding the artist to include but not be limited to their address, contact information, or other information the artist themselves have not already expressly disclosed on the site.

- Hate speech or any speech designed to elicit feelings of fear, terror, or apprehensiveness toward violence against someone’s person or property. Speech may be words, images, or any conveyance of information designed to be interpreted as conveying meaning.

- Critical comments not grounded in artistic theory are generally unappreciated and unwelcome in instances of those comments merely ‘bashing’ work for the sake of belittling the product alone.

- Any behavior, action, or communication Art Hub Studio LLC deems – in its sole discretion – to negatively impact their operations and cultivation of an artistic marketplace.

While we strive to offer free and unfettered exchange of ideas within our communication services, we recognize there may be some users who strive only to sow discord and controversy in their participation. In the event we determine at our sole discretion that your history of participation in our site or any participation associated with your account is detrimental to establishing and cultivating an environment of artistic exchange, we reserve the right to take action as necessary in regard to your account. This includes – as listed elsewhere in this document – account suspension, termination, and other revocations of account privileges as we deem necessary. Simply put, don’t be mean, and keep it civil.
