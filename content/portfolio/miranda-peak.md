\

\
Miranda's photography will be represented by Art Hub Studio. Miranda has a melancholy style to their photographs. The subjects of Miranda's photos generally contain the pragmatic and bitter sweet side of life. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows.

### Whether it be a dark feathered Corvus, a nostalgic scene fading from time, or the lingering cessation of a flower, Miranda's photography will have you feeling wistful.

Miranda does a fantastic job of capturing movement in photography. They have photographs of instruments being played in motion and people bustling in a crowd to make images come alive.\
\
Miranda is compiling a portfolio exhibiting the cultural struggles and differences of being raised  mixed-heritage in a mono-ethnic culture: a recipe for ostracization, forced social isolation, and internalized racism at the hands of others. This portfolio will shine light on Miranda's Japanese American half by construing illustrations of Miranda's lineage following the second world war.\
\
Art Hub Studio would be honored to represent people of mixed-heritage descent through this portfolio.\
