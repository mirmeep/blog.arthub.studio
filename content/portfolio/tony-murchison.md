### The Artificer

Tony Murchison is a Netherlands-based artist and 3D-designer. He uses both digital and traditional media to create drawings, paintings, miniatures, and miscellaneous other designs. His work usually focuses on the subversion of traditional folklore and fantasy stereotypes.

### Tony's paintings depict monsters showing kindness, hunted creatures becoming hunters, or mice learning magic against all odds.
\
Tony's fascination for art started at a young age. He would create elaborate pencil portraits of his favorite characters and stories. Tony held onto his passion for art into adulthood where he accomplished formal education on the subject.\
\
As a young adult, Tony attended Delft University. While pursuing drawing classes and learning formal design skills, Tony discovered his own personal style. This allowed him to develop professionally.

### Honing his skills, Tony took the initiative to learn both digital painting and 3D sculpting on his own.

Following graduation, Tony took on professional artwork. He has taken private and commercial commissions, sold designs and prints, and received donations in appreciation for his public works.\
\
Tony was kind enough to allow Art Hub Studio to use his artwork for practicing large format printing during our start-up phase.\
\
 Art Hub Studio will represent Tony by selling prints of his artwork at our store. We hope Tony can pave a path for other Artists to become successful by using our services.\
