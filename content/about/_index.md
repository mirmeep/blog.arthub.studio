Art Hub Studio LLC creates Video blogs that represent artists, galleries, and museums. By creating content for our viewers, we hope to connect Artists to Collectors. By gaining an audience, viewers, and subscribers, Art Hub Studio LLC will be able to accomplish its ultimate goal of opening an online art marketplace where **artists can sell their work for free**. 

*How will it work?*
The expenses accumulated for our services will be covered by the customer at the time of purchase. Whatever you list your product for on our website is what you will get. We calculate the commissions and add it to the price of your artwork for you.

**If you want to sell artwork online for free, we need your support to accomplish this goal. View how to support us down below.**

On top of creating a free online store for artists to sell their art, Art Hub Studio LLC will **provide high quality prints to collectors**. We will standardize the quality of our prints to prevent pixels and graininess.

**Art Hub Studio LLC's mission is to fix common problems that happen with other online art marketplaces. These problems include Unfair revenue to artists and poor quality prints.**
