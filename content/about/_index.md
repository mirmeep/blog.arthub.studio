#### What is Art Hub Studio LLC?

Art Hub Studio LLC is a startup company dedicated to solving two major problems with online art sales; fair revenue to artists and standards for high quality prints.

As of now, we are only selling stretched canvas and wall posters of artwork. As the company grows, we'll incorporate the sale of original art and possibly other printing methods.

#### What ensures a quality print?

*Care in the craft and attention to detail!*\
\
Here, at Art Hub Studio, we focus on quality over quantity.\
\
Art Hub Studio LLC has a small local workshop in Upstate New York where quality material is used to handcraft beautifully framed and stretched canvases.\
\
All products go through a standardized quality control check to ensure the color profile and materials are visually appealing for the collector.\
\
*You can guarantee to get a product that was cared for, start to finish.*
