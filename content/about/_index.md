#### What is Art Hub Studio LLC?

Art Hub Studio LLC is a startup company dedicated to solving two major problems with online art sales; fair revenue to artists and standards for high quality prints.

- Received unfair commissions at other online art galleries? Not here.

- Got a mass produced print that's low quality? Not here.

As of now, we are only selling stretched canvas and wall posters of artwork. As the company grows, we'll incorporate the sale of original art and possibly other printing methods.

#### How do artist commissions work?

Artists' decide their own flat rate commission per unit.\
\
Art Hub Studio LLC will discuss a recommended commission with the artist based on market research, time, and materials put into the art, but ultimately the artist knows how much they spent making a piece and what they need to earn on their unique piece.\
\
** Just be aware that we're not schmucks and won't sell your canvas prints for a $3,000 commission per unit. As long as the artist is reasonable with their request, we'll be reasonable back.\
\
Here are recommended commission requests based on Market research, time and material spent: [Recommended Commissions Chart].

#### What ensures a quality print?

***Care in the craft and attention to detail!***\
Massed produced garbage is too popular these days. What happened to the good old times where there is care put into the art you're producing?\
\
Art Hub Studio LLC has a small local workshop where quality material is used to handcraft beautifully framed and stretched canvases.\
\
All products go through a standardized quality control check to ensure the color profile and materials are visually appealing for the collector - and not thoughtlessly thrown into a box and shipped to you.\
\
Heck, it might not be the most profitable as thoughtless mass production, but it's an honest days work here at Art Hub Studio LLC and **you can guarantee to get a product that was cared for, start to finish.**
